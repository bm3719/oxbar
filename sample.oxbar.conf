# This is a sample configuration file for oxbar.
# By default, oxbar tries to load ~/.oxbar.conf on startup.
# That can be changed using `-F /path/to/another.conf` on the command line.
# Regardless of which config file oxbar loads, you can instruct a running
# instance of oxbar to reload that config (and theme) while running by
# sending it a HUP signal (typically just `pkill -HUP oxbar`).
#
# This sample configuration explains the format of the config file. Config
# files are parsed with fparseln(3), which is rather robust.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored.

# blank lines like the one above and below are ignored

# most lines look something like this, and alter some setting about oxbar
window.y = 0

window.y = 0  # comments can also be at the end of a line

# spacing can be flexible
window.y=0
   window.y   =  0   

# lines can be continued with a trailing '\' at end of a line
window.y \
   = \
   0

# oxbar also supports "themes", which are a subset of settings in the config
# file starting with a line like:
#     [ThemeName]
# which are then optionally loaded at runtime by running oxbar like this:
#     $ oxbar [options] ThemeName
# When run like that, all lines in the config file before ANY theme name
# are treated as global and loaded, and then only lines AFTER [ThemeName], and
# before any other theme definition, are loaded. If no such line [ThemeName]
# appears in the config, oxbar reports an error and exits.

# This is useful when you run multiple instances of oxbar (say one for the top
# of your display and another at the bottom), or want to simply test different
# visuals quickly and easily (remember you can use a `pkill -HUP oxbar` to
# reload the config at runtime).
# If you only ever run one instance of oxbar, you do not need to define themes.

# Following that example, we now define some sample themes

# Run via `oxbar top`
