# This is a sample configuration file for oxbar.
# By default, oxbar tries to load ~/.oxbar.conf on startup.
# That can be changed using `-F /path/to/another.conf` on the command line.
#
# This sample configuration explains the format of the config file. Config
# files are parsed with fparseln(3), which is rather robust.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored.

# blank lines like the one above and below are ignored

# most lines look something like this, and alter some setting about oxbar
window.y = 0

window.y = 0  # comments can also be at the end of a line

# spacing can be flexible
window.y=0
   window.y   =  0   

# lines can be continued with a trailing '\' at end of a line
window.y \
   = \
   0

# oxbar also supports themes or "named configuration", which are a subset of
# settings in the config file starting with a line like:
#     [SomeName]
# which are then optionally loaded at runtime by running oxbar like this:
#     $ oxbar [options] SomeName
# When run like that, all lines in the config file before any named section
# are loaded (as always) but then only lines after such a named section are
# loaded. If no such named section is found, oxbar reports an error and exits.

# This is useful when you have one oxbar running on the top (perhaps in the
# background) and another at the bottom (always in the foreground) of your
# display, each showing their own widgets and information. In this case, one
# configuration file can be used to support both instances.

# If you only ever run one instance of oxbar, you do not need to define themes.

# Following that example, we now define two named sections: one for the version
# of oxbar running at the top of the screen called 'Top', and another for the
# bottom of the display called 'Bottom'.
